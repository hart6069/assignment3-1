I had problems getting the code to run at first due to some missing semicolons. After I fixed that, everything worked good and the code was organized very well which made it easy to follow. I like how you changed the default messages to something a bit more custom. The layout of the program was great and your navigation was very easy to follow, and was easy to see the part of the application from. Great Job!
